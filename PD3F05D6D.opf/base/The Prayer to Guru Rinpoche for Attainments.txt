The Prayer to Guru Rinpoche for Attainments

by the First Dodrupchen Rinpoche


orgyen rinpoche la solwa deb
To Orgyen Rinpoche we pray,
galkyen barché minjung shying
Grant us—without impediment or obstacles arising—
tünkyen sampa drubpa dang
Favourable circumstances, the fulfilment of our aspirations,
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsol
And attainments, ordinary and supreme.

The precious master Guru Rinpoche appeared in a vision to Dodrupchen Rinpoche Jikmé Trinlé Özer
while he was visiting Khachö Palgyi Tsaridra. Immediately, he spoke the words of this
prayer; such is its blessing. Maṅgalaṃ!
