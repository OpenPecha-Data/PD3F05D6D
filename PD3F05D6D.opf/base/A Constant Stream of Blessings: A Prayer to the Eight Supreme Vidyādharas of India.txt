A Constant Stream of Blessings
A Prayer to the Eight Supreme Vidyādharas of India,

namkün chokden chökü khaying lé
In the sky-like space of dharmakāya, emptiness endowed with all kinds of skilful means supreme,
yenlak dünden longkü nyagyé da
Rises the full moon of the saṃbhogakāya maṇḍala, complete with its seven attributes,
duljé tso la samyé tulkü tsul
Manifesting for all those to be tamed in nirmāṇakāya forms that defy the imagination:
gyutrul drawar gyur la solwa deb
Masters of the web of magical illusion, to you I pray!

In the east, in the charnel ground of Chilly Grove,

Opening the door to the secret treasury of Yangdak, the wisdom mind,

You attained siddhis, and mastery over the wish-fulfilling treasure:

Master Hūṃkāra, to you I pray!

In the south, in the charnel ground of Perfect in Form,

You reaped the full harvest of the four vajras:

Mañjuśrīmitra, at your feet I pray!

In the west, in the charnel ground of Lotus Heap,
pema sung gi chuter rab gal né
Crossing Hayagrīva’s ocean of wisdom speech,
jita jinyé khyenpé nor tobpa
You discovered the riches of the knowledge of the multiplicity of things and of their true nature:

Nāgārjuna Garbha, at your feet I pray!

jangchok langka tsekpé durtrö du
In the north, in the charnel ground of the Mound of Lanka,
purpa trinlé dorjé tsön dungpé
Striking with the vajra weapon of Kīlaya—enlightened activity,
si sum ying su drolwé tu tobpa
You obtained the power to liberate all three worlds of existence into space:

Prabhāhasti, at your feet I pray!

In the south-east, in the charnel ground of the Spontaneously Accomplished Mound,

You maximized your experience of uncontaminated great bliss:

In the south-west, in the charnel ground of the Display of Great Secrets,

By employing the vital force of the nectar of enlightened qualities,

You arose, without transference, in the supreme rainbow body:

Vimalamitra, at your feet I pray!

nubjang héchen dalwé durtrö du
In the north-west, in the charnel ground of Pervasive Great Joy,
jikten chötö pungtsok rab ngampé
By crushing the forces of worldly offering and praise,
marung dü dé yulngo pam jepé
You conquered the armies of the unruly legions of māras:
rombu guhyé shyab la solwa deb
Rombuguhya, at your feet I pray!

jangshar jikten tsekpé durtrö du
In the north-east, in the charnel ground of Mound of the Worlds,
drakngak möpé mepung rab barwé
By igniting a fireball of maledictory wrathful mantras,
pégol tsishing sekpé tu tobpa
You gained the power to incinerate aggressors and their forests:
shantim garbhé shyab la solwa deb
Śāntigarbha, at your feet I pray!

ku sum gyalwé shyingkham tamché du
In all the pure realms of the buddhas, of the three kāyas,
drubdé gyé la ngönpar changchub né
By directly attaining enlightenment in the eight sections of practice,
rigdzin nam shyi gopang chok nyepa
You attained the supreme state of realization of the four vidyādharas:
orgyen tötrengtsal la solwa deb
Orgyen Tötreng Tsal, to you I pray!

detar solwa tabpé gyalnam kyi
Through this prayer of mine,
khyen tsé nüpé jinlab palyön kün
May I obtain all the blessings, auspiciousness, and qualities of the wisdom, compassion and
power of all the buddhas,
dak gi lek tob dorjé kur min té
And maturing into the vajra body,
malü drowé pal du gyurwar shok
Bring auspiciousness and good for every single living being!

This prayer to the eight supreme vidyādharas, “A Constant Stream of Blessings”, was composed
by the dzogchen yogi Jikmé Trinlé Özer, for whom no obstacles due to doubts ever occurred
since he had been properly empowered into the maṇḍala of the secret mantrayāna. He attained
confidence in this prayer, which arose instantaneously at the request of Döndup Gyatso,
a Rabjampa of the Gelugpa tradition at Kokonor in the north. By the power of the merit of
writing this prayer, may the blessings of the vidyādharas enter the mindstreams of all with
whom he has a connection.
