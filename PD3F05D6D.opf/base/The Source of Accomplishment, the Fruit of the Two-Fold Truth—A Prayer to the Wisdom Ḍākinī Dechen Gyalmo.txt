The yoginī Yeshe Tsogyal!
This prayer to the wisdom ḍākinī Yeshe Tsogyal, entitled The Source of Accomplishment, the Fruit
of the Two-Fold Truth was discovered from the casket of meditative equipoise and written
during the post-meditation phase by the yogi Kunzang Shenpen at the fervent request of
the yogi Samantabhadra Dharmadvīpa, who is rich in wealth of learning, samaya and devotion;
and of Tsoknyi Wangmo, a niece of mine, who has ripened her virtuous actions of the past.
It was transcribed by Gyurmé Yeshe. May it be meritorious! Sarva maṅgalaṃ.
